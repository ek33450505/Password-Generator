# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description
The purpose of this project was to create a random password generator by utilizing JavaScript. This project required the deployed web page to generate a random password between 8 and 128 characters in length and allows the user the option of using at least one of the following characters: symbols, numbers, uppercase letters or lowercase letters. When the user clicks the "generate" button on the page they are presented with a series of prompts allowing them to choose the password length and character types they would like to use. If the user does not choose the a password length within the required paramaters or does not choose a valid character option, then they are presented with an aditional prompt advising them that an error has been made. Once all prompts are answered with a vaild answer a random password is generated in the text-box based on the selected user parameters.
